## Commit 9848829a | 2026-02-26T21:47:18.744Z

Initial v0.1.0 commit establishing the project memory and decoupled parser / report-view architecture.

### Branch Purpose

Primary development branch for `pi-token-burden`, a `pi` extension designed to analyze and visualize the system prompt's token budget and section breakdown.

### Previous Progress Summary

Initial commit.

### This Commit's Contribution

Established the v0.1.0 foundation, memory tracking, and CI pipeline.

- Initialized GCC memory management to track project architectural decisions and roadmap evolution.
- Developed a v0.1.0 core including a `/context-budget` command for real-time visibility into session context usage.
- Implemented a decoupled architecture (Parser/Formatter/Report-View) to allow independent evolution of analysis logic and UI presentation.
- Established a high-confidence CI pipeline and local development environment with TDD, linting, and duplicate/dead code detection.
- Leveraged the `factory-extension` profile to ensure strict TypeScript compliance and alignment with `pi-coding-agent` best practices.

## Commit 0dc586f6 | 2026-03-02T04:46:30.524Z

Renamed the command to `/token-burden` and upgraded to real BPE tokenization.

### Branch Purpose

Primary development branch for `pi-token-burden`, a `pi` extension designed to analyze and visualize the system prompt's token budget and section breakdown.

### Previous Progress Summary

Initialized the project memory and established a v0.1.0 foundation.

This included a decoupled architecture for analyzing the `pi` system prompt and an interactive TUI overlay. Established a rigorous CI pipeline using Vitest for TDD, oxlint/oxfmt for code quality, and established a local development workflow for extension testing.

### This Commit's Contribution

Refined naming, token counting, and documentation accuracy.

- Renamed the extension command from `/context-budget` to `/token-burden` across all source code, documentation, and implementation plans for better clarity and branding.
- Upgraded the token counting implementation and documentation to use actual BPE tokenization (`gpt-tokenizer` with `o200k_base` encoding) instead of the previous character-based heuristic.
- Corrected architectural documentation by removing a "phantom" `formatter.ts` reference, simplifying the core data flow description to match the actual implementation.
- Resolved a tooling conflict where `oxfmt` incorrectly attempted to format hidden `.memory/` or `.gcc/` state files; fixed by switching to the `ignorePatterns` configuration key in `.oxfmtrc.jsonc`.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` to accurately reflect the refined architecture, the new command name, and current test coverage (21 tests).
- Housekeeping: Distilled a large accumulation of log data from multiple uncommitted prior sessions into this single structural update.

## Commit 074e7ea0 | 2026-03-02T06:02:16.792Z

Planned the `pi-skill-toggle` integration with a three-state model and merged-overlay architecture.

### Branch Purpose

Refine and extend the `pi-token-burden` extension to include skill management (enable/hide/disable) directly within the token-budget visualization.

### Previous Progress Summary

Initialized the project and established a v0.1.0 foundation with a decoupled architecture for analyzing the `pi` system prompt.

Implemented a `/token-burden` command with an interactive TUI overlay and BPE tokenization (`o200k_base`). Standardized the command name and fixed architectural documentation to match the implemented Parser/Report-View model. Established a rigorous CI pipeline with Vitest, oxlint, and oxfmt.

### This Commit's Contribution

Brainstormed and planned skill-toggle integration into the TUI.

- Completed brainstorming and detailed technical planning for integrating `pi-skill-toggle` functionality into the `pi-token-burden` TUI.
- Decided on a merged-overlay architecture where skill toggling is accessible only within the "Skills" drill-down view to maintain a clean top-level overview.
- Committed to a three-state skill model (Enabled/Hidden/Disabled), confirming that `disable-model-invocation` (Hidden) removes skills from the system prompt, thus reducing token burden.
- Designed a hybrid data-sourcing strategy: using prompt parsing for the overall budget view and filesystem discovery for the skill management list (to show disabled skills).
- Aligned skill discovery logic with `pi`'s actual directory scan order (project-local → ancestor → user-global) and implemented coherent duplicate handling where all copies of a named skill toggle together.
- Specified an "update-in-place" UI behavior where toggling skills immediately recalculates the budget and redraws the bar chart before saving.
- Authored a comprehensive 8-task implementation plan across two phases (Discovery/Persistence and UI Integration) with a rigorous TDD and property-based testing strategy using `fast-check`.

## Commit 28d807d9 | 2026-03-02T17:53:20.208Z

Implemented the full skill-management lifecycle and toggle-mode UI.

### Branch Purpose

Refine and extend the `pi-token-burden` extension to include skill management (enable/hide/disable) directly within the token-budget visualization.

### Previous Progress Summary

Initialized the `pi-token-burden` extension with a decoupled architecture for analyzing the `pi` system prompt using BPE tokenization (`o200k_base`) and an interactive TUI overlay.

Brainstormed and planned the integration of `pi-skill-toggle` functionality, defining a three-state model (Enabled/Hidden/Disabled) and a merged-overlay architecture where skill management is handled within the "Skills" drill-down view. Designed a hybrid data-sourcing strategy combining prompt parsing with filesystem discovery to allow management of skills not currently in the prompt.

### This Commit's Contribution

Shipped skill discovery, persistence, and the toggle-mode TUI with 67 passing tests.

- Implemented the full skill-management lifecycle, including filesystem discovery (matching `pi`'s scan order), state persistence to `settings.json`, and dynamic path resolution via `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`.
- Integrated a specialized "Skill Toggle" mode into the `BudgetOverlay` TUI with keyboard-driven state cycling, fuzzy search support, and an "Unsaved Changes" indicator.
- Established a robust persistence flow with "Ctrl+S" saving and a confirmation prompt for discarding unsaved changes, ensuring user intent is preserved.
- Refined the UI rendering with a new legend for skill states (Enabled/Hidden/Disabled) and immediate budget recalculation upon state changes.
- Fixed a critical navigation bounds bug where the drill-down view used section counts instead of skill counts, and improved error handling by returning success/failure status from the toggle callback.
- Expanded the test suite to 67 passing tests, incorporating unit tests for discovery and persistence, and integration tests for the interactive UI components.
- Validated `pi`'s actual skill discovery behavior, ensuring `scanSkillDir` correctly identifies root-level `.md` files as skills to match the core agent's resource loader.

## Commit 27268839 | 2026-03-03T04:42:25.053Z

Built the tmux-based e2e TUI test harness and a 15-test suite.

### Branch Purpose

Refine and extend the `pi-token-burden` extension to include skill management (enable/hide/disable) and comprehensive end-to-end (e2e) TUI testing via tmux.

### Previous Progress Summary

Established a decoupled architecture for the `pi-token-burden` extension, providing an interactive TUI for analyzing system prompt token usage via BPE tokenization (`o200k_base`).

Integrated a three-state skill management model (Enabled/Hidden/Disabled) into the "Skills" drill-down view, enabling users to toggle skills and observe real-time budget impact. Implemented filesystem-based skill discovery, state persistence to `settings.json`, and a robust interactive UI with fuzzy search and "Ctrl+S" saving, supported by a 67-test unit and integration suite.

### This Commit's Contribution

Delivered the e2e framework, fixed a snap-back bug, and isolated e2e config.

- Developed a robust e2e TUI test framework (`TmuxHarness`) that automates `pi` sessions within tmux, enabling programmatic interaction (sendKeys) and visual verification (capture-pane).
- Implemented a 15-test e2e suite covering overlay rendering, section navigation, AGENTS.md drill-down, and the full skill-toggle lifecycle (state cycling, fuzzy search, and persistence).
- Resolved a UI "snap-back" bug where the overlay would revert to stale skill states after a successful save; fixed by updating underlying `discoveredSkills` and rebasing token counts upon persistence.
- Configured a separate Vitest project (`vitest.config.e2e.ts`) with extended 30s timeouts for e2e tests, ensuring isolation from the fast unit test suite.
- Hardened the testing environment using `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` for filesystem isolation and a low-cost provider (`zai/glm-4.7`) to minimize token usage during TUI verification.
- Improved e2e test resilience by using search loops for section navigation and dynamic skill name retrieval, avoiding failures caused by varying sort orders or hardcoded identifiers.
- Updated project documentation (`AGENTS.md`) with e2e execution commands and an expanded file map for the new testing infrastructure.

## Commit 487652c6 | 2026-03-03T06:03:14.912Z

Released v0.3.0 with open-in-editor support via the terminal-handover pattern.

### Branch Purpose

Primary development branch for `pi-token-burden`, a `pi` extension for visualizing and managing the system prompt's token budget, including skill-toggle management and integrated file editing.

### Previous Progress Summary

Initialized the project with a decoupled architecture for parsing system prompts using BPE tokenization (`o200k_base`) and visualizing the budget via an interactive TUI overlay.

Integrated a three-state skill management model (Enabled/Hidden/Disabled) into the "Skills" drill-down view, allowing users to toggle skills and observe real-time budget impact. Established a rigorous quality baseline with 67 unit tests and a custom tmux-based e2e TUI harness (`TmuxHarness`) that automates visual verification and keyboard interaction within `pi` sessions.

### This Commit's Contribution

Implemented editor handoff, standardized editor resolution, and tagged v0.3.0.

- Implemented an "open-in-editor" feature (v0.3.0) enabling direct editing of `SKILL.md` or `AGENTS.md` files from the TUI using the `e` key.
- Adopted the `tui.stop()` / `tui.start()` lifecycle pattern to yield the terminal to external editors and resume the overlay state without data loss.
- Standardized editor resolution via a new `getEditor()` helper following the `$VISUAL` → `$EDITOR` → `vi` convention.
- Refactored logic into a shared `launchEditor()` method to support consistent behavior across both skill-toggle and AGENTS.md drill-down modes.
- Enhanced the UI with conditional footer hints that dynamically display the "edit" shortcut only when the selected item supports it.
- Validated the feature with 4 unit tests for environment resolution and 4 e2e tests covering hint visibility and visual recovery after editor sessions.
- Tagged v0.3.0, formally releasing skill-toggle management, BPE tokenization, and the e2e testing infrastructure.

## Commit 1f692345 | 2026-03-11T04:38:34.430Z

Generalized open-in-editor to all prompt sections using ephemeral temp files.

### Branch Purpose

Refine and extend the `pi-token-burden` extension to provide deep visibility and management of the system prompt token budget, including interactive skill toggling, e2e testing, and integrated viewing/editing of prompt components.

### Previous Progress Summary

The project established a modular architecture for parsing `pi` system prompts using BPE tokenization (`o200k_base`) and visualizing usage via an interactive TUI overlay.

It integrated a three-state skill management model (Enabled/Hidden/Disabled) with filesystem discovery and persistence, allowing users to reduce token burden by hiding unused skills. A custom tmux-based e2e test harness was developed to verify TUI interactions and visual state. Most recently, the v0.3.0 release introduced direct editing of `SKILL.md` and `AGENTS.md` files from the overlay using the terminal-handover pattern to bridge the TUI and external editors.

### This Commit's Contribution

Extended editor support to all sections with a read-only header for generated content.

- Generalized the "open-in-editor" feature to support all top-level prompt sections, including the dynamically generated base prompt and metadata.
- Decided to use ephemeral temp files in the system's temporary directory to allow viewing of raw section text that does not originate from a single user-editable file.
- Implemented a read-only header mechanism for non-file sections to prevent user confusion between viewing generated content and editing source files.
- Refined TUI input routing to correctly distinguish between section-level text viewing and item-level file editing depending on the active navigation mode.
- Fixed a pre-commit hook conflict by excluding Markdown files from automatic formatting, ensuring documentation and state files remain stable during commits.
- Validated the expanded editor support with a suite of new unit and e2e tests, confirming robust visual recovery and terminal state integrity across editor sessions.

## Commit 38d01742 | 2026-03-11T05:08:42.354Z

Fixed a temp-file race with asynchronous editors by dropping eager cleanup.

### Branch Purpose

Primary development branch for `pi-token-burden`, focusing on system prompt token analysis, skill management, and interactive visualization within the `pi` TUI.

### Previous Progress Summary

The project established a modular architecture for parsing `pi` system prompts using BPE tokenization (`o200k_base`) and visualizing usage via an interactive TUI overlay.

It features a three-state skill management model (Enabled/Hidden/Disabled) with filesystem discovery and persistence to `settings.json`, allowing users to reduce token burden. A custom tmux-based e2e test harness (`TmuxHarness`) ensures TUI stability. Most recently, the extension generalized the "open-in-editor" feature to support all prompt sections (including the base prompt and metadata) using temporary files and a read-only header mechanism, while also refining pre-commit hooks to exclude Markdown files from formatting.

### This Commit's Contribution

Resolved the async-editor empty-file bug and hardened the pre-commit hook.

- Fixed a bug where viewing prompt sections in asynchronous editors (like VS Code) resulted in empty files due to a race condition with temp file cleanup.
- Identified that `spawnSync` returns immediately for background-forking editors, causing the cleanup logic to delete the temporary file before it could be read by the editor.
- Resolved the issue by removing the `unlinkSync` cleanup step in `report-view.ts`, opting to let the operating system handle the disposal of temporary files in `/tmp`.
- Confirmed that fluctuations in base prompt token counts (e.g., from ~400 to ~1700) accurately reflect changes in the active `pi` session's tools and preamble, verifying parser reliability.
- Hardened the lint-staged pre-commit hook by ensuring Markdown files are dropped from `oxfmt` rules to prevent conflicts with auto-generated documentation and memory state.

## Commit f69305e0 | 2026-03-18T13:14:37.009Z

Implemented the deterministic Base-prompt source-tracing engine (Slices 1-4).

### Branch Purpose

Primary development branch for `pi-token-burden`, a pi extension for system prompt token analysis and skill management, now featuring deterministic source tracing for extension-added bloat.

### Previous Progress Summary

`pi-token-burden` provides an interactive TUI for analyzing system prompt token usage via BPE tokenization (`o200k_base`).

It features a three-state skill management model (Enabled/Hidden/Disabled) with `settings.json` persistence and a terminal-handover pattern for editing all prompt components (skills, AGENTS.md, and raw sections) directly from the overlay. Stability is ensured by a comprehensive test suite including a custom tmux-based e2e TUI harness for visual verification and a modular architecture that separates parsing, attribution, and rendering.

### This Commit's Contribution

Added the base-trace subsystem, Trace Mode in the TUI, and 29 new tests.

- Implemented a deterministic source-tracing engine for the Base prompt (Slices 1-4) to attribute token usage to specific extensions.
- Rejected brute-force subprocess diffing and static parsing in favor of a one-pass introspection analyzer that reuses pi-core's internal loader for high-fidelity matching.
- Added 5 specialized modules in `src/base-trace/` for line extraction, attribution logic, extension inspection, and fingerprint-based caching.
- Integrated an interactive "Trace Mode" into the `BudgetOverlay` TUI (triggered by the `t` key on the Base prompt) with support for evidence drill-downs and refresh.
- Adopted a strict normalization matching model (whitespace collapsing and trimming) to ensure attribution parity with pi-core's internal prompt assembly.
- Expanded the test suite with 29 new unit and integration tests (105 total), verifying reconciliation between extension, shared, core, and unattributed token buckets.

## Commit 43530ade | 2026-03-18T13:42:52.924Z

Completed source tracing (Slices 5-6) with 8 e2e tests covering the trace lifecycle.

### Branch Purpose

Primary development branch for `pi-token-burden`, a `pi` extension for system prompt token analysis and skill management, featuring interactive visualization and deterministic source tracing.

### Previous Progress Summary

`pi-token-burden` provides an interactive TUI for analyzing system prompt token usage via BPE tokenization (`o200k_base`).

It features a three-state skill management model (Enabled/Hidden/Disabled) and a terminal-handover pattern for editing all prompt components (skills, AGENTS.md, and raw sections) directly from the overlay. It includes a deterministic source-tracing engine for the Base prompt, attributing token usage to specific extensions using a one-pass introspection analyzer and an interactive "Trace Mode" with evidence drill-downs and fingerprint-based caching.

### This Commit's Contribution

Finished trace verification and discovered extension tools use the function-calling API.

- Completed the final implementation phases (Slices 5-6) for Base prompt source tracing, moving the feature from implementation to full verification.
- Added 8 e2e tests using `TmuxHarness` covering the entire trace lifecycle: hint visibility, trace view rendering, bucket drill-down navigation, and on-demand refresh.
- Discovered that extension tools contribute via the LLM's function-calling API rather than system prompt text, confirming that the Base prompt consists almost exclusively of built-in pi-core content.
- Updated the project README with a comprehensive keyboard shortcuts table and detailed documentation for the new tracing feature.
- Hardened the `BudgetOverlay` drill-down logic and fixed a pre-existing e2e test failure related to section navigation.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with an expanded file map, an updated architecture diagram reflecting the `base-trace` subsystem, and verified test counts (105 unit + 29 e2e).

## Commit 8485150b | 2026-03-18T14:54:31.660Z

Added a Tool definitions section to track hidden function-schema token cost.

### Branch Purpose

Primary development branch for `pi-token-burden`, a pi extension for system prompt token analysis and skill management, featuring interactive visualization, deterministic source tracing, and tool definition counting.

### Previous Progress Summary

`pi-token-burden` provides an interactive TUI for analyzing system prompt token usage via BPE tokenization (`o200k_base`).

It features a three-state skill management model (Enabled/Hidden/Disabled), a terminal-handover pattern for editing prompt components, and a deterministic source-tracing engine for Base prompt attribution. The project uses a robust modular architecture with a 134-test suite (105 unit + 29 e2e) ensured by a custom tmux-based TUI harness (`TmuxHarness`). Recent work confirmed that the Base prompt consists of built-in pi-core content, as extension tools contribute via the LLM function-calling API rather than the system prompt text.

### This Commit's Contribution

Counted tool schemas via `pi.getAllTools()` and reached 111 passing tests.

- Implemented a "Tool definitions" section in the budget breakdown to track the hidden token cost of function schemas sent via the LLM's tool-calling API.
- Added support for opening tool definitions in the user's editor using the `e` key; individual tools now carry a `content` field with their pretty-printed JSON schema for inspection.
- Updated `BudgetOverlay` to handle both file-based editing (AGENTS.md/Skills) and content-based viewing (Tool definitions) in drilldown mode using temporary files.
- Extended the `PromptSection` and `TableItem` types to carry optional content buffers, enabling uniform "open-in-editor" behavior across all navigated items.
- Corrected a systemic undercounting of the context window by incorporating `pi.getAllTools()` data into the total token and character calculations.
- Verified the implementation with 6 new unit tests for the tool section builder and updated e2e tests, reaching a total of 111 passing tests.
